I have decided to recreate my mostly unused website (previously in jekyll) to Gatsby with and React. 
This is pretty much all brand new and i hope to be able to share some of my successes and failures as I go. Hopefully i can keep it going.

I used the gatsby-starter-minimal-blog starter that i found on the gatsbyjs website.
